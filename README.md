Write a simple airline ticket reservation program. The program should display a menu with the following options: reserve a ticket, cancel a reservation, check whether a ticket is reserved for a particular person, and display the passengers. The information is maintained on an alphabetized linked list of names. In a simpler version of the program, assume that tickets are reserved for only one flight. In a fuller version, place no limit on the number of flights. Create a linked list of flights with each node including a pointer to a linked list of passengers.

2 Guidelines

You should implement and use linked list class (the option of using a list class from STL is acceptable, though discouraged)
